#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Close one GitHub issue, only when the issue's recorded history shows the process was
# followed. Run through the make target, from the project folder:
#     make issue-close N=<issue number> [REASON=completed|not-planned]
# or directly: bash _docs/agent-kit/scripts/issue-close.sh <number> [completed|not-planned]
#
# Only the orchestrator closes issues (process.md, Lifecycle step 9). This is the one
# sanctioned way; it does nothing else to an issue: no edit, label, reopen, delete or
# comment. It prints one line on success.
#
# What it reads (all from the comments of the REPOSITORY OWNER's account; a comment from
# any other account, or from a deleted account (null author), is ignored for every check).
# A QA verdict is the first line: FAIL if it says FAIL anywhere, PASS only if it starts
# `QA: PASS` (team/qa-engineer.md). An Engineer comment reports a commit when it says
# "commit" and holds any 7 to 40 hex characters, all-digit short hashes included:
#   completed, Standard or Heavy: the issue is open and has `approved`; the latest `QA:`
#     verdict is PASS; at least one `QA:` PASS (two for `tier:heavy`) was posted at or
#     after the last `Engineer:` comment that reports a commit; an `Orchestrator:` Close
#     comment at or after the latest PASS has the lines
#         QA PASS commit: <7 to 40 hex>   (this value must appear in the latest PASS)
#         Merge commit: <7 to 40 hex>
#         Verify: <text>
#         Summary: <path>
#   completed, Light (`tier:light`): `approved`; an `Engineer:` comment with a
#     `tier-check: PASS` line; an `Orchestrator:` Close comment at or after it with the
#     Merge commit, Verify and Summary lines and `Human approved diff: yes`. No QA.
#   not-planned: an `Orchestrator: Close as not planned` comment with the lines
#         Human approved closure: <YYYY-MM-DD>
#         Backlog review: <path or comment URL>
#     No `approved` label and no QA verdict are needed.
# The tier is the highest tier label (heavy over standard over light); none is Standard.
# Comments are ordered by createdAt, ties by their order in the list; "at or after"
# compares createdAt only, so a PASS posted at the same time counts as after.
# The script checks the recorded lines, not the facts: it cannot see that a commit
# exists or that the human approved a diff. All roles share the owner's account, so
# the checks stop mistakes and shortcuts, not a role set on bypassing the process.
#
# The repository is the GITHUB_REPO line of agent-kit.conf (github_api.py validates it);
# the REST API is used because `gh issue` cannot find the repository from the git remote
# everywhere (Kiro Web). The only gh calls it makes are these shapes, fixed here, never
# built from issue text (the first three are made by github_api.py, every page of the
# comments is read):
#     gh api repos/<repo>/issues/<N>
#     gh api "repos/<repo>/issues/<N>/comments?per_page=100&page=<P>"
#     gh api repos/<repo>
#     gh api repos/<repo>/issues/<N> --method PATCH -f state=closed -f state_reason=completed
#                                            (or -f state_reason=not_planned)
# (the last is the only write). It fails closed: if gh is missing, fails, prints nothing
# or malformed JSON, or a field is missing, it refuses and closes nothing.
#
# Exit codes: 0 closed; 1 gh failed on the close (no retry); 2 bad N or REASON (no gh
# command ran); 4 refused, or could not check.
